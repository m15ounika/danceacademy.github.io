        “Dance is a way of exploring life” -Ramona Jacobs
         Dance is passion for some people, whereas many others take it as profession. Everyone can dance in his or her own way. Today, dance has evolved into a glorious form of communication. Degree courses have been introduced focusing on dance, and people are taking it quite seriously.
        Dance has a vast range of potential. It makes the students capable of developing several essential life skills like creativity, problem-solving, expressive skill, and critical communication skills. The physical benefits of dance include development of body balance, improved coordination, better motor skills, etc. Dance promotes healthy and fit lifestyle.
        Besides, students learn certain soft skills like imagination, collaboration, tolerance, group work, communication, etc. Social inclusion is also boosted by dance.
